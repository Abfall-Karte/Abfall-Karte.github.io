.. currentmodule:: routenfinder_server


Programm Documentation
======================

This is a command line application. You can call the main function with ``python server.py``. In the following documentation this will be shortened to just ``server.py``. 
Then a function in ``Controller`` is called, which handles the behavior. In the ``Network`` class everything network related is handled.
